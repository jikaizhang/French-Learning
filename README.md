# French Learning

Do you want to learn French, or any language at all? This will be an ideal website for you. You can add, update, and delete vocabularies in your personal list.

The application uses Angular for frontend and Spring Boot for backend. The frontend talks to the backend through RESTful APIs, and all the data (vocabularies) are 
stored in the H2 database. A JWT Spring Security Framework is set up to authenticate multiple user login information.

This is a screenshot of a sample vocabulary list of the website:
